# Set Covering Problem

Different algorithms for solving the Set Covering Problem in C. The lsscp.c file contains four constructive heuristics:

 1. Random constructive heuristic
 2. Static cost-based heuristic
 3. Static cover cost-based heuristic
 4. Adaptive cover cost-based heuristic

Also, iterative best- and first-improvement algorithms are implemented. Redundancy elimination can be applied after the constructive heuristic and after each iteration of the iterative improvement algorithms.

This project is part of the course Heuristic Optimization given at VUB and ULB.
